Mars Rover Kata
===============

This is the first step in the Design Patterns katas to be followed by Electron squad as a way to improve our design skills.

Description
-----------

Develop an api that moves a rover around on a grid.

* You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
* The rover receives a character array of commands.
* Implement commands that move the rover forward/backward (f,b).

Implementation
--------------

* Use TDD to solve the kata. 
* First, try to solve the kata without any design pattern, using usual programming constructions. 
* After that try to refactor your code to use the [Command Pattern](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/command)
